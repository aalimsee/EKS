# üìä Prometheus vs Grafana

This document compares **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, two essential tools in modern observability stacks.

## üß† Purpose

| Tool         | Description                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prometheus** | A monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects and stores time-series metrics. |
| **Grafana**     | A visualization and analytics platform that reads data from Prometheus and other sources to create dashboards. |

## üîç Key Differences

| Feature/Aspect         | **Prometheus**                                              | **Grafana**                                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Time-series database & monitoring system                    | Visualization & dashboarding tool                           |
| **Primary Function**   | Collects, stores, and queries metrics                       | Displays metrics using customizable dashboards               |
| **Query Language**     | PromQL (Prometheus Query Language)                         | Uses PromQL or the language of connected data sources         |
| **Alerting**           | Integrated with Alertmanager                                | Alert rules via dashboards (can use Prometheus as backend)    |
| **Data Sources**       | Own built-in time-series database                          | Supports Prometheus, Loki, MySQL, Elasticsearch, and more     |
| **Visualization**      | Minimal (basic graph UI)                                    | Rich and customizable UI                                     |
| **Integration**        | Scrapes from exporters, Kubernetes, etc.                   | Integrates with >80 data sources                             |
| **Deployment**         | Kubernetes native, often deployed via Helm                  | Runs as a service or pod with persistent storage              |

## üéØ When to Use

| Use Case                                      | Tool to Use     |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Collecting metrics from Kubernetes nodes     | Prometheus      |
| Alerting on resource usage                   | Prometheus + Alertmanager |
| Creating dashboards for CPU, memory, network | Grafana         |
| Viewing pod or container metrics             | Grafana         |

## üîÅ Common Architecture

```text
[Kubernetes Nodes + Exporters]
            |
      [Prometheus]
            |
    [Prometheus TSDB]
            |
        [Grafana]
         (Dashboards, Alerts)
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Use Prometheus** to collect and store metrics with alerting capabilities.
- **Use Grafana** to visualize and analyze those metrics through dashboards.

Together, they provide a powerful observability stack for any cloud-native environment.
